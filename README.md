# VSM test
Tests of the VSM (Volcanic and Seismic Modelling) tool. Code in https://github.com/EliTras/VSM

The folders (e.g., the test mogi1NA) are organized as

<path>/USECASE/mogi1NA/
  
Data is in 
  
<path>/USECASE/DATA/
  
while the VSM package should be in
  
<path>/VSM/

All the tests use data from the 2011-2013 unrest at Campi Flegrei caldera (Italy). GPS data are from INGV-OV network, InSAR data are processed by INGV from COSMO-SkyMed images (ASI, Agenzia Spaziale Italiana).

  Tests 'sill2NA' and 'sill2BI' contain Jupyter Notebooks also.
