# VSM test
Tests of the VSM (Volcanic and Seismic Modelling) tool. Settings specified in the table. Code in https://github.com/EliTras/VSM

The folders (e.g., the test mogi1NA) are organized as \
_<path>/USECASE/mogi1NA/_
  
Data in \
_<path>/USECASE/DATA/_

while the VSM package should be in \

All the tests use data from the 2011-2013 unrest at Campi Flegrei caldera (Italy). GPS data are from INGV-OV network, InSAR data are processed by INGV from COSMO-SkyMed images (ASI, Agenzia Spaziale Italiana).
